What will be the output of this program?
class Color {
     int red, green, blue;

     void Color() {
             red = 10;
             green = 10;
             blue = 10;
     }

     void printColor() {
           System.out.println("red: " + red + " green: " + green + " blue: " + blue);
     }

     public static void main(String [] args) {
             Color color = new Color();
             color.printColor();
     }
}

Anwer: Contructor has return type of void, so will be treated as a method.
and hence the o/p would be .
Compiles fine, and when run, it prints the following: red: 0 green: 0 blue: 0
